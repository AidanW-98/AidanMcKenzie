# 19th June to 3rd July 2024 - 2 Weeks of Fairytales and Firesides

Brief goes here - hikes, glastonbury, and meeting henry

## The Anxious Pre-Amble (17th & 18th June)

So there I was - late monday morning, not having a proper job to go for about 2 weeks now I've grown into the habbit of starting my morning routine a bit late; getting ready for I'm not sure what. Though this was interuppted to a see a text - inviting me to work at Glastonbury festival. After a bit of chat and not-much convincing, I was in. In 5 days we'd be in Glastonbury festival.

Now I had a purpose and a reason to go to the office; plan my holiday, the CV can wait. A lot of messages and a few scraps of paper later it was decided; in 2 days I'd be hiking in the Pennines with Tim, then I'd meet Sam in Dufton, and we'd head to Glastonbury - with a few stops on the way. 

For a day and a half I exchanged excitement for stress and had the logistics in place:
  
  - A borrowed tent and sleeping back were packed into my travel backpack along with a handful of clothes, bare essentials, pain relief for my knees, and lots of food and water.
  - [say shit about this.....] A large suitcase full of festival clothes and more lavish toiletries sent down through royal mail to a friends house in Bedford
  - MP3 player updated with <>
  - Keys with Erin
  - Barber trip

## A bit of the Pennine Way (19th - 21th June)

- Morning: dropped of the suitcase to royal mail, shoved a curry pot and the remains of a Papa John's into the backpack and headed towards Waverley station
  - Thought: should have been a nice 20 minute walk; but my legs were aching, shoulders hurting, and I was panting by the time I got to my seat...
- A train to Darlington, a local bus to Barnard Castle (evil looks for pizza out of a food waste bin bag), and another bus to Middleton-in-Teesdale and I was in the campsite. 4 hours before my friend was due to arrive and without the faintest clue what to do with my tent.
- He turned up early, and he set up my tent for me while I had the important job to see to my cold curry pot. Off to the pub; a few pints and a few main dishes later it was back to the campsite. 
- After a night of <crazy dreams> and an episode of sleep paralysis involving a curry van; we hit the path for 9am.
- Good walk, waterfalls, sheep, and good chat. 20 miles of it.
- Hitting the hay in an <amazing view point> with sheep all around. Longest day of the year, well spent.

## A change of scenery (21st June & 22nd June)

- A transfer; Sam arrived meeting us in Dufton, a quick sarnie and the hiking boots were off me and the <something was on>. Passenger Princess.
- We both stopped off in Bedford for the night - out to the pub with Kitty & Davis, and sleeping on their floor.
- A cafe stop, a supermarket trip, and we were off to Glastonbury...

## The (Irish) Underground Piano Bar (22nd June - 25th June)

- A lovely chilled out time
- Living in a commune and not doing much at all

## Glastonry itself (26th June - 30th June)

- The sound had arrived.

## A slow trip back home (1st & 2nd July)

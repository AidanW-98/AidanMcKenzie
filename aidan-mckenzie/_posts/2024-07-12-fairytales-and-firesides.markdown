Here's a quick story for ya - I was holidaying around England for 2 weeks which included hiking in the Pennines, a few road-trips, seeing lots of good folk, and working a secret stage in Glastonbury. Hopefully there's some good craic here.

## The Anxious Pre-Amble: 17th & 18th June

There I was going through my morning routine at about 11am on a Monday - I was behind my fictional schedule and rushing to get ready for... I'm not sure what. See, me and my entire department had very recently been made redundant. What should I do today - work on my CV and get job hunting, or make an excuse to chill-out more and feign an excuse of an emotional impact?

Well thankfully that decision was taken away from me. Despite this blog, let's cut a long story short - I got an unexpected text inviting my to work at Glastonbury, after very little convincing and confirming that I wouldn't pouring pints in unpaid shifts, I was in. In 5 day I'd be in the rolling green hills of tbe UK's biggest festival... Now I had a purpose for at least a couple days; plan my holiday, the CV can wait.

I never really like planning, I prefer doing. But it's got to be done. A lot of messages and a few scraps of paper later, it was decided:

- The idea of joining my friend for a day of hiking Pennine Way would now happen on Thursday; camping Wednesday to Friday
- I'd get down to London through a variety of public transport and meet Sam
- He'd drive and we'd get to Glastonbury a few days before the festival opens, for "work" - what *work* that would be and what would happen next I was fine to leave as a surprise.
- Sam might drive us back to Edinburgh, or we might do something else... We'll see.

Of course first I'd need to spend 2 days manically running round Edinburgh:

- Collecting a tent & sleeping bag to borrow
- Picking up power banks, lots of food, hiking bits, and Iburpofen for my kneess
- Dropping off some keys to my soon-to-be flatmate
- MP3 Player updated with more YouTube clips and audiobook snippets
- Quick beard trim at the barber
- Deep clean the flat (and discover that I've been sleeping on a mouldy mattress)
- Packing a suitcase for festival clothes and Glastonbury luxuries like toiletries, to be sent down to Bedford with Royal Mail
- Sorting backpack for Pennines essentials and stuffing it full of nuts, curry pots, a couple books, and a XXL Papa John's.

And many more I'm sure. Honestly, I'm not expecting this to be interesting at all, but hopefully you see why I'd call describe this pre-amble as *anxious*.

## A taste of the Pennine Way: 19th & 20th June

A friend of mine, Tim, was walking the entire Pennine Way and kindly invited me to join for part of it. A day should be enough for me, and it was booked in as per our above plan. First part, meet at his destination camp site.
A royal mail trip, train to Darlington and 2 local buses turned out to be a fairly smooth journey. The main events just being getting caught in a school rush and receiving some evil looks for eating cold pizza out a food waste bag.

Tim had a long walk that day, and I arrived early afternoon - which unfortunately meant that I would have 4 hours to myself with just an unpitched tent to keep me company. Funnily enough, this turned out to just be 5 minutes... Tim got cheeky little lift and that put a big smile on my face. He was put to work on putting up my tent while I dealt with a couple curry pots.

Afternoon and evening were very well spent in the best pubs Middleton-in-Teesdale had to offer and I ate my way through 3 main courses featuring a lot of great chat! My later evening was full bizzare dreams and an episode of sleep paralysis involving a curry van and monkeys invading the camp site. There were at least 3 times that I woke up that morning and started our day, only for it later to be revealed that I was still dreaming. Not sure what caused this, I was a bit on edge from the terrifying chicken occupying the toilet block in the evening. But nothing got in my way for our prompt 9am start.

The walk was incredible. Incredible views and incredibly hard. 20 miles of peacefull streams, green hills, waterfalls, lots of sheep and some fantastic chat and office gossip. I loved it. We stopped off a couple times for a waterfall swim and a bit of food (soreen never fails) and I just about kept up with the brutal 3mph walking pace (I did have a heavy backpack). We hit the hay wildcamping at *Highcup Nick* surrounded by and within nature. The longest day of the year was well spent.

## Another change of scenery: 21st & 22nd June

Now, we were actually able to work a bit of magic into our planing. Me and Tim walked a few miles into Dufton and to a certain rendezvous point cafe where Sam drove through to from Durham and joined us. We stayed for some tea and scran, caught up with life, and I was into Sam's car; my hiking boots were off, and Tim was carrying on his walk. I was very greatful as Sam drove about an hour and a half out of his way to pick us up and drive down South.

Despite Sam's plan to go to a party in London, we stopped off in my regular Bedford pub where I used to work. We met some friends of mine, had lots of food and drinks, and then stayed the night at theirs. The next day featured a supermarket trip for a weeks worth of drinks and snacks, anoter cafe stop, a bit of a roadtrip, and then we were there - Glastonbury.

First things first was an intense amount of faff. We met some of the crew who were in a frantic state as a few things went wrong and security had increased. We were stuck in what felt like the river-crossing riddle with a fox, a chicken, and some grain... Resolved eventually by sneaking a few crew members in and leaving some cars behind for a day. Very confusing and I still don't really understand it. But, we were in and it was only late afternoon. We found our commune, set up our tents, met some more crew, explored the empty festival and I spent the evening sat around the fire meeting some extraordinary people.

## The Underground Irish Piano Bar: 23rd - 25th June

I didn't learn much about what I'd be doing before arriving, and it wasn't even clear 2 days after arriving. But what I did know was that I was to be part of the *The Underground Piano Bar*:

- This is a well-fabled hidden stage at Glastonbury Music Festival which has been going on for I think 30 years now.
- The entertainment consists of a mix `(better word for mix)` of music, poetry, theatre, storytelling, and anything Irish. Many acts are booked, but open mic contributions inevitably appear too - even I could be offered!
- The stage itself is hidden in the forest; a big hole in the ground with a make shift stage and seats made from logs, covered by a blacked out wooden ceiling and lit by hanging candles.
- The stage seats about 60 people, but every year word travels fast about a hidden stage and there can be queues lasting for hours to try and get one of these magic seats.
- Our location was secret; no one is permitted to tell others about this and if asked - we'd be encouraged to lie.

On that note, considering it's so hidden I really shouldn't be blogging about this... Just do an internet search about this.

Anyway - I'd be a generic dogsbody, filling in where needed for maybe a couple hours a day to help build the stage and maybe be pulled in as a bouncer when we open. These two days were spent living live on the slow. Sleeping well, spending the days reading, chatting, chilling, and spending the evenings at the fireside. I did maybe an hour of work in this time; patching holes in a wall. It almost sounds wholesome.

We tried a couple staff nights out blah blah... (drag queen pub quiz).

The fireside chats were an experience. It would be a thundering circus of excentric stories and improntu Irish folk songs, including a certain man who I shall call *Irish Buck* jumping with joy at telling his own tales, riddles, and jokes. There was me between it all pointlessly trying to have a normal conversation. I was even once on the hearing end of a haunting redention of the Pied Piper story featuring slavery, child traficking, and opium... And that was at 11am when I was looking for work. Everyone here is a character. I quite enjoyed this life.

## The Music Arrives: 26th & 27th June

Wednesday is when the gates open and the festival starts. So I made the most out of it and I was floating through music stages, continuing random odd jobs, chilling, more music, more drinks, bit of raving, fireside chilling, music and repeat - in no particular order. We even met someone who is Steve Angello's mate and runs his label, and an artist who ghost-produces for Timmy Trumpet, Hybrid Minds, Gordon City and more (there's another secret out), while we were taking shade under a recycled plastic turtle. It was so strange seeing our peaceful green hills and colour stages now being swarmed with people and parties.

So I'm actually quite against pop and chart music, but to my surprise Glastonbury was quite accomodating of this. Across this Wednesday and Thursday, I saw and have a lot of love for the following acts:

- Afriquoi
- Dance Class
- Daniel Avery (from outside the tent)
- Fulu Miziki
- Kurupt FM
- Opening ceremony
- Many others too...

The GreenPeace stage was getting firmly established as my favourite. Good music so far, big fan of the stage design, lots of vegan food stalls nearby, and the was even a skate rank. Back home the stories around the fire continued, I could even see that these guys got a bit nervous sometimes telling these stories and had the stories well rehearsed. The forced-links between were of note too - "oh ye alright there lad? Whatcha doing, drinking tea? Tell you what - I was once drinking coffee. Ya know where? Jamaica! `buckle in for a crazy story`". I usually didn't mind too much, as long as I wasn't hangry.

## The Hole Opens: 28th - 30th June

I was keeping to my policy of <blah blah blah staying away from mainstage>.

I can summarise the hole three very short videos.

At this point the compost toilets were worryingly full.

## Slowly Back to Thistle 1st & 2nd July

Back home to the mouldy mattress. (I slept really well in a tent, sleeping bag, and mat - so may as well continue).

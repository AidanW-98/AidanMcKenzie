So here's a story basically about nothing for ya. I was going around combining a few different trips into a holiday, which even then wasn't particularly eventful enough to write about - but I have been looking to try out writing (to a low level), so here we are. It includes hiking in the pennines and working at a secret stage in Glastonbury music festival. Hopefully there's some good craic here.

## The Anxious Pre-Amble: 17th & 18th June

There I was going through my morning routine at about 11am on a Monday - I was behind my fictional schedule and rushing to get ready for... I'm not sure what. Me and the majority of my department had very recently been made redundant. So today I could work on my CV and get job hunting, or I could chill-out a bit more and feign an excuse of an emotional impact.

But thankfully that decision was taken away from me. Despite this blog, let's cut a long story short - I got an unexpected text inviting my to work at Glastonbury, after very little convincing and confirming that I wouldn't pouring pints in unpaid shifts, I was in. In 5 day I'd be in the rolling green hills of tbe UK's biggest festival... And now I had a purpose for at least a couple days; plan my holiday, the CV can wait.

I never really like planning, I prefer doing. But it's got to be done. By Tuesday I burnt through lot of messages and some scraps of paper later I ended up with a loose idea of what I'd be upto.

- The idea of joining my friend Tim for some hiking of the Pennine Way would now happen on Thursday; camping Wednesday to Friday
- I'd get down south through a variety of public transport and meet Sam in London
- He'd drive and we'd get to Glastonbury a few days before the festival opens, for "work" - what *work* that would be and what would happen next I was fine to leave as a surprise.
- Sam might drive us back to Edinburgh, or we might do something else... We'll see.

Of course first I'd need to spend 2 days manically running round Edinburgh:

- Collecting a tent & sleeping bag to borrow
- Picking up power banks, lots of food, hiking bits, and Iburpofen for my kneess
- Dropping off some keys to my soon-to-be flatmate
- Loading up my MP3 player with more YouTube clips and audiobook snippets
- Getting a quick beard trim at the barber
- Deep cleaning the flat (and discover that I've been sleeping on a mouldy mattress)
- Sorting backpack for Pennines essentials and stuffing it full of nuts, curry pots, a couple books, and a XXL Papa John's.
- Packing a suitcase for festival luxuries like more clothes and toiletries, to be sent down to Bedford with Royal Mail

And many more I'm sure. Honestly, I'm not expecting this to be interesting at all, but hopefully you see why I'd call describe this pre-amble as *anxious*.

## A taste of the Pennine Way: 19th & 20th June

So Tim was walking the entire Pennine Way and kindly invited me to join for part of it. First part, meet at his destination camp site.

A royal mail trip, train to Darlington and 2 local buses turned out to be a fairly smooth journey. The main events just being getting caught in a school rush and receiving some evil looks for eating cold pizza out a food waste bag.

Tim had a long walk that day, and I arrived early afternoon - which unfortunately meant that I would have 4 hours to myself with just an unpitched tent to keep me company... This dreaded wait actually turned out to just be 5 minutes as Tim got cheeky little lift up for half his walk that day. That put a big smile on my face. He was put to work on putting up my tent while I dealt with a couple curry pots.

Afternoon and evening were very well spent in the best pubs Middleton-in-Teesdale had to offer and I ate my way through 3 main courses featuring a lot of great chat! My later evening was full bizzare dreams and an episode of sleep paralysis involving an Indian food van and monkeys invading the camp site. Then when I woke up that morning and started our day, I got hit the realisation that I was still dreaming - and this happened 3 times in a loop. Not sure what caused this, I was a bit on edge from the terrifying chicken occupying the toilet block in the evening. But nothing got in my way for our prompt 9am start.

The walk was incredible. Incredible views and incredibly hard. 20 miles of peacefull streams, green hills, waterfalls, lots of sheep and some fantastic chat and office gossip. I loved it. We stopped off a couple times for a waterfall swim and a bit of food (soreen never fails) and I just about kept up with the brutal 3mph walking pace (I did have a heavy backpack). We hit the hay wildcamping at *Highcup Nick* surrounded by and within nature. The longest day of the year was well spent.

## Another change of scenery: 21st & 22nd June

Now, we were actually able to work a bit of magic into our planing. Me and Tim walked a few miles into Dufton and to a certain rendezvous point cafe where Sam drove through to from Durham and joined us. We stayed for some tea and scran and I was into Sam's car; my hiking boots were off, and Tim was left to carry on his walk. I was very greatful that Sam drove about an hour and a half out of his way to pick us up and drive down South.

Despite Sam's plans in London, we stopped off in my regular Bedford pub where I used to work. We met some friends of mine, had lots of food and drinks, and then stayed the night at theirs. The next day had a supermarket trip, a cafe stop, a bit of a roadtrip, and then we were there in Glastonbury.

First things first was an intense amount of faff. We met some of the crew who were in a frantic state as a few things went wrong and security had increased. We were stuck in what felt like the river-crossing riddle with a fox, a chicken, and some grain... Resolved eventually by sneaking a few crew members in and leaving some cars behind for a day. Very confusing and I still don't really understand it. But, we were in and it was only late afternoon. We found our commune, set up our tents, met some more crew, explored the empty festival and I spent the evening sat around the fire meeting some extraordinary people.

## The Underground Irish Piano Bar: 23rd - 25th June

I didn't learn much about what I'd be doing before arriving, and it wasn't even clear 2 days after arriving. But what I did know was that I was to be part of the *The Underground Piano Bar*:

- This is a well-fabled hidden stage at Glastonbury Music Festival which has been going on for I think 30 years now.
- The entertainment consists of a concoction of music, poetry, theatre, storytelling, and anything Irish. Many acts are booked, but open mic contributions inevitably appear too - even I could be offered!
- The stage itself is hidden in the forest; a big hole in the ground with a make shift stage and seats made from logs, covered by a blacked out wooden ceiling and lit by hanging candles.
- The stage seats about 60 people, but every year word travels fast about a hidden stage and there can be queues lasting hours to try and get one of these magic seats.
- Our location was secret; no one is permitted to tell others about this and if asked - we'd be encouraged to lie.

On that note, considering it's so hidden I really shouldn't be blogging about this... Oh well, I don't expect anyone to read this.

Anyway - I'd be a generic dogsbody, filling in where needed for maybe a couple hours a day to help build the stage and maybe be pulled in as a bouncer when we open.

For two days I spent living life on the slow. Sleeping well, spending the days reading, chatting, chilling, and spending the evenings at the fireside. I did maybe an hour of work in this time to patch some holes in a wall. It almost sounds wholesome.

The fireside was always an experience. It would be a thundering circus of excentric stories and improntu Irish folk songs, including an *Irish Buck* jumping with joy at telling his own tales, riddles, and jokes. There was me between it all pointlessly trying to have a normal conversation. I was even once on the hearing end of a haunting redention of the Pied Piper story featuring slavery, child traficking, and opium... And that was at 11am when I was looking for work. Everyone here is a character. I quite enjoyed this life.

## The Music Arrives: 26th & 27th June

Wednesday is when the gates open and the festival starts. It was so strange seeing our peaceful green hills and vibrant empty stage spaces now being swarmed with people and parties. And there was a dramatic change in tune; long gone were my chillout times as there was the constant sound of 5 different music stages blaring together into an ongoing car crash of a soundscape.

But I'm more than happy to get involved. These days I was floating through music stages, continuing random odd jobs, chilling, more music, more drinks, bit of raving, fireside chilling, music and repeat - in no particular order. We even met someone who is Steve Angello's mate and runs his label, and an artist who ghost-produces for Timmy Trumpet, Hybrid Minds, Gordon City and more (there's another secret out), while we were taking shade under a recycled plastic turtle.

I'm against pop and chart music, but to my surprise Glastonbury was well accomodating to this. Across this Wednesday and Thursday I saw and have a lot of love for the following acts:

- Afriquoi
- Daniel Avery DJ Set (from outside the tent)
- Fulu Miziki
- Kurupt FM
- Opening ceremony
- A dance class of sorts, possible Salsa
- And many others too...

The GreenPeace stage was getting firmly established as my favourite. Good music so far, great stage design, a skate rank, and lots of vegan food stalls nearby. Back home the stories around the fire continued, I could even see that these storytellers got a bit nervous at times and had the stories well rehearsed. The forced-links between were of note too - "oh ye alright there lad? Whatcha doing, drinking tea? Tell you what - I was once drinking coffee. Ya know where? Madagascar! {strap in for a super crazy storytime}". I didn't mind at all, as long as I wasn't hungry.

## The Hole Opens: 28th - 30th June

This is when things got wobbly.

- Making the most of my time here, seeing a ridiculous number of acts
- Wondering around by myself, checking out the chilled out acoustic green stages.
- A lot people were saving their energy, I then saw why.
- And at midnight, we opened. I never could have dreamt of what I saw next (fanny flaps etc).
- Fear kicked in with not actually being allowed in

Friday:

- Andrew Maxwell Morris + other chilled out cafe green stages
- Zawose Queens
- Cat Capers
- Circus

Saturday:

- Eric Prydz
- Heilung
- Lankum
- Nubiyan Twist

Sunday:

- Psychadelic Porn Crumpets
- Justice
- The Scratch
- <hip hop stuff at Strummerville>

I was keeping to my policy of <blah blah blah staying away from mainstage>.

I can summarise the hole three very short videos.

The fairytale was running thin and reality was kicking in. The campsite was getting fuller and fuller, the compost toilets were worryingly full.

## Slowly Back to Thistle 1st & 2nd July

Back home to the mouldy mattress. (I slept really well in a tent, sleeping bag, and mat - so may as well continue).

The Irish Buck jumping and flapping around all about father ted.

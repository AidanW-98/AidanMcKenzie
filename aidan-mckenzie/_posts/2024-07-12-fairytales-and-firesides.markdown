Here's a quick story for ya - just all about my very last minute 2 week trip around England; <STUFF GOES HERE>

## The Anxious Pre-Amble: 17th & 18th June

There I was rushing through my morning routine at about 11am on a Monday - getting ready for I'm not sure what. See, me and my entire department had recently been made redundant.

Cut to the case - an unexpected text invited my to work at Glastonbury, after very little convincing I was in; in 5 days I'd be at the <festival desc here>... Now I had a purpose for at least a couple days; plan my holiday, the CV can wait.

A lot of messages and a few scraps of paper later, it was decided:

- The idea of joining my friend for a day of hiking Pennine Way would now happen on Thursday; camping Wednesday to Friday
- I'd passenger princess my way to Glastonbury on Thursday, with an overnight stay at friends in Bedford.
- We'd get to Glastonbury a few days before the festival opens, for "work" - what *work* that would be and what would happen next I was fine to leave as a surprise.

Of course first I'd need to spend 2 days manically running round Edinburgh:

- Collecting a tent to borrow
- Picking up power banks, hiking bits and Iburpofen for my kneess
- Dropping off some keys to my soon-to-be flatmate
- MP3 Player updated with more YouTube clips and audiobook snippets
- Quick beard trim at the barber
- Packing a suitcase for festival clothes and Glastonbury luxuries like toiletries, to be sent down to Bedford with Royal Mail
- Sorting backpack for Pennines essentials and stuffing it full of nuts, curry pots, a couple books, and a XXL Papa John's.

And many more I'm sure. Honestly, I'm not expecting this to be interesting at all, but hopefully you see why I'd call describe this pre-amble as *anxious*.

## A taste of the Pennine Way: 19th & 20th June

A royal mail trip, train to Darlington and 2 local buses turned out to be a fairly smooth journey. The main events just being getting caught in a school rush and receiving some evil looks for eating cold pizza out a food waste bag.

In this trip, I'd join a friend Tim who was walking the entire Pennine Way - of course I'd only do one day. <CHANGE THIS SHIT>. 
Tim had a long walk that day, and I arrived early afternoon - so I should have had 4 hours to myself with just a tent to set up. But it turned out to just be 5 minutes... Tim cheekily got a lift. That put a big smile on my face. He was put to work on putting up my tent while I dealt with a couple curry pots.
Afternoon and evening were very well spent in the best pubs Middleton-in-Teesdale had to offer and I ate my way through 3 main courses featuring a lot of great chat!

My later evening was fully of crazy dreams and an episode of sleep paralysis involving a curry van and monkeys invading the camp site. Not sure what caused this, I was a bit on edge from the terrifying chicken occupying the toilet block. But nothing got in my way for our prompt 9am start.

The walk was incredible. Incredible views and incredibly hard. 20 miles of peacefull streams, green hills, waterfalls, lots of sheep and some fantastic chat and office gossip. I loved it. We hit the hay wildcamping at *Highcup Nick* surrounding by and within nature. The longest day of the year was well spent.

## Another change of scenery: 21st & 22nd June

We walked a few miles into Dufton and at our rendezvous point cafe where Sam joined us. We stayed for some tea and scran, caught up with life, and I was into Sam's car and my hiking boots were off. I was very greatful for Sam driving an hour and a half out of his way to pick up and take us to my home town of Bedford.

Despite our plan, we stopped off in my regular Bedford pub where I used to work. We met some friends of mine, had lots of food and drinks, and stayed the night. The next day featured a supermarket trip for a weeks worth of drinks and snacks, anoter cafe stop, a bit of a roadtrip, and then we were there - Glastonbury.

First things first was an intense amount of faff. We met some of the crew who were in a frantic state as a few things went wrong and we were stuck in what felt like the river-crossing riddle with a fox, a chicken, and some grain... Resolved eventually by sneaking a few crew members in and leaving a car behind for a day. I still don't really understand it.

We were in and it was only late afternoon. We found our commune, set up our tents, met some more crew, explored the empty festival and I spent the evening sat around the fire meeting some extraordinary people.

## The Underground Irish Piano Bar: 23rd - 25th June

I didn't learn much about what I'd be doing before arriving, and it wasn't clear even 2 days after arriving. But I was to be part of the *The Irish Underground Piano Bar*:

- This is a hidden stage at Glastonbury Music Festival which has been going on for over 20 years now.
- The entertainment consists of a <better word for mix> of music, poetry, theatre, and anything Irish. Many acts are booked, but open mic contributions inevitably appear too - even I could be offered!
- The stage itself is hidden in the forest; a big hole in the ground with a make shift stage and seats made from logs, covered by a blacked out wooden ceiling and lit by hanging candles.
- The stage seats about 60 people, but every year word travels fast about a hidden stage and there can be queues lasting for hours to try and get one of these magic seats.
- Our location was secret; no one is permitted to tell others about this and if asked - we'd be encouraged to lie.

On that note, considering it's so hidden I really shouldn't be blogging about this... Just do an internet search about this.

Anyway - I'd be a generic dogsbody, filling in where needed for maybe a couple hours a day to help build the stage and maybe be pulled in as a bouncer when we open. These two days were spent living live on the slow. Sleeping well, spending the days reading, chatting, chilling, and spending the evenings by the fireside. I did maybe an hour of work in this time; patching holes in a wall. It almost sounds wholesome.

The fireside chats were an experience. It would be a thunder storm of excentric stories and improntu Irish folk songs, including a certain man who I shall call *Irish Buck* jumping with joy at telling his own stories, riddles, and jokes. There was me between it all pointlessly trying to have a normal conversation. I was even once on the hearing end of a haunting redention of the Pied Piper story featuring slavery, child traficking, and opium... And that was at 11am when I was looking for work. I quite enjoyed this life.

## The Music Arrives: 26th & 27th June

Wednesday is when the gates open and the festival starts. So I made the most out of it and I was floating through music stages, continuing random odd jobs, chilling, more music, more drinks, parties, fireside chilling, music and repeat - in no particular order. We even met Steve Angello's manager and a fairly big name producer in the mix of all this, while taking shade under a recycled plastic turtle. It was so strange seeing our peaceful greenhills and <decor???> now being swarmed with people and parties. 

I saw the following acts


I've got a lot of love for <music acts who I saw>. I was keeping to my policy of <blah blah blah staying away from mainstage>.

- The people and the music arrive
- Some music going on
- Meeting the people under the turtle
- Opening ceremony
- Music, work, chill, music, fireside, music, repeat. In no particular order.

The dance class lol

## The Hole Opens: 28th - 30th June

I can summarise the hole three very short videos.

At this point the compost toilets were worryingly full.

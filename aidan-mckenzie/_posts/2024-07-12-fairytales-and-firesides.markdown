Here's a quick story for ya - just all about my very last minute 2 week trip around England; <STUFF GOES HERE>

## The Anxious Pre-Amble: 17th & 18th June

There I was rushing through my morning routine at about 11am on a Monday - getting ready for I'm not sure what. See, me and my entire department had recently been made redundant.

Cut to the case - an unexpected text invited my to work at Glastonbury, after very little convincing I was in; in 5 days I'd be at the <festival desc here>... Now I had a purpose for at least a couple days; plan my holiday, the CV can wait.

A lot of messages and a few scraps of paper later, it was decided:

- The idea of joining my friend for a day of hiking Pennine Way would now happen on Thursday; camping Wednesday to Friday
- I'd passenger princess my way to Glastonbury on Thursday, with an overnight stay at friends in Bedford.
- We'd get to Glastonbury a few days before the festival opens, for "work" - what *work* that would be and what would happen next I was fine to leave as a surprise.

Of course first I'd need to spend 2 days manically running round Edinburgh:

- Collecting a tent to borrow
- Picking up hiking bits and Iburpofen for my knees
- Quick beard trim at the barbers
- Dropping off some keys to my soon-to-be flatmate
- MP3 Player updated with more YouTube clips and book readings
- Packing a suitcase for festival clothes and Glastonbury luxuries like toiletries, to be sent down to Bedford with Royal Mail
- Sorting backpack for Pennines essentials and stuffing it full of nuts, curry pots, a couple books, and a XXL Papa John's.

And many more I'm sure. Honestly, I'm not expecting this to be interesting at all, but hopefully you see why I'd call describe this pre-amble as *anxious*.

## A taste of the Pennine Way: 19th & 20th June

A royal mail trip, train to Darlington and 2 local buses turned out to be a fairly smooth journey. The main events just being getting caught in a school rush and receiving some evil looks for eating cold pizza out a food waste bag.

In this trip, I'd join a friend Tim who was walking the entire Pennine Way - of course I'd only do one day. <CHANGE THIS SHIT>. 
Tim had a long walk that day, and I arrived early afternoon - so I should have had 4 hours to myself with just a tent to set up. But it turned out to just be 5 minutes... Tim cheekily got a lift. That put a big smile on my face. He was put to work on putting up my tent while I dealt with a couple curry pots.
Afternoon and evening were very well spent in the best pubs Middleton-in-Teesdale had to offer and I ate my way through 3 main courses featuring a lot of great chat!

My later evening was fully of crazy dreams and an episode of sleep paralysis involving a curry van and monkeys invading the camp site. Not sure what caused this, I was a bit on edge from the terrifying chicken occupying the toilet block. But nothing got in my way for our prompt 9am start.

The walk was incredible. Incredible views and incredibly hard. 20 miles of waterfalls, hills, lots of sheep and catching up on office gossip. I loved it. We hit the hay wildcamping at *Highcup Nick* surrounding by and within nature. The longest day of the year was well spent.

## Another change of scenery: 21st & 22nd June

We walked a few miles into Dufton and at our rendezvous point cafe where Sam joined us. We stayed for some tea and scran, caught up with life, and I was into Sam's car and my hiking boots were off. I was very greatful for Sam driving an hour and a half out of his way to pick up and take us to my home town of Bedford.

Despite our plan, we stopped off in my regular Bedford pub where I used to work. We met some friends of mine, had lots of food and drinks, and stayed the night.

## What an adventure that was

We are bitter losers, snarling through our smiles
We're the lost boys, in the supermarket isles
We're Christmas dogs, dumped by the side of the road
Confused, we will run for miles
We are road rage
We are stone age
We are wild
We are busted light bulbs, in a backstreet neon sign
We're the shaking gun, in a service station line
We'll drink though we're drunk,
We'll sink though we've sunk
We're fucked but we say that we're fine
We are rampage,
Missing back page's in our spine
We long, for journeys and the roadside
We long, for starlight and the low tide
Yeah, we long, for fairy tales and firesides
And oh,
We are coffeehouse cynics,
Too righteous, too rigid to believe
Disappointed romantics,
Scraping the heart's from our sleeves
We're the toothless drunk,
We're the ageing punk
Yeah, we are Adam,
We're the apple and we're Eve
We are beggars with shiny pennies, on our knees
We long, for sunlight on the hillsides
Yeah, we long, for yesterdays and hindsight
Oh, we long, for fairy tales and firesides
And oh,
Yeah we long for carnivals and fairground rides
Oh, we long for journeys and the roadsides
Oh, we long for fairy tales and firesides

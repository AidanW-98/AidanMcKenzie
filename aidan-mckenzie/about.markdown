# About

This website is created by Aidan McKenzie simply to organise and share his thoughts and projects. So, this is me - in this site you can see my memories of being a DJ, some rambling stories of mine, and hopefully some of music too!

## Website?

I made this website myself using Jekyll with custom themes; I'm no web developer - but thought I'd give it a go. The codebase is available on [GitHub]( {{ site.additional_social_links.github_repo }} ).

This website has an ethos: concise and simple. This is done to minimise any maintenance and reduce the risk of the content becoming outdated. But I'm known to _rambe_ on - so we'll see how that goes...

## Where to find me
